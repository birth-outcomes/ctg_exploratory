## CTG datasets

Summary of other CTG datasets, compared with the CTU-UHB dataset, created with support from [M'Barek et al. 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10311205/) and [Mendis et al. 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10525263/).


### Both raw recordings and features

| Dataset and links | Record number | Format of signal data | Outcome | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FHR morphological analysis (FHRMA) dataset - [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711018302498) | 156 | Raw FHR signals sampled at 4Hz. Features of FHR (baseline, acceleration and deceleration) as determined by 12 different methods.| None | Public[[source]](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201907.0039/v1) |

There is an [FHRMA github](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA) and [FHRMA wiki](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/wiki).

The raw FHR records are available for the [training](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/tree/master/FHRMAdataset/traindata) and [test](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/tree/master/FHRMAdataset/testdata) data. These are .fhr files which can be opened with the fhropen.m function in MATLAB. They were sampled at 4Hz. For each sample, a uint32 serves as the UNIX timestamp for the beginning of the recording. Next, a uint16 corresponds to the FHR from the first sensor (multiplied by 4), a uint16 for the FHR signal from the second sensor (multiplied by 4) (unused here), a uint8 for the TOCO signal (multiplied by 2), and a uint8 reserved to store signal quality (unused here). 

The main folder in the GitHub repository contains functions from the software, including functions for analysis with the 12 methods, which follow a file structure of 'aa'm then method - e.g. [aamwmfb.m](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/blob/master/aamwmfb.m).

[The analyses folder in the github](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/tree/master/FHRMAdataset/analyses) contains MAT files which have record of when accelerations and decelerations occur for each record, according to the different methods. The methods are [listed here](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/wiki/FHRMA-dataset). As described on the [dataset page](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/wiki/FHRMA-dataset), these files contain:
* Filename (name of the record)
* Baseline (baseline signal sampled at 4Hz)
* Accelerations (2xn table with beginning and end of each acceleration in minutes)
* Decelerations (2xn table with beginning and end of each deceleration in minutes)
* Overshoots (2xn table with beginning and end of overshoots in minutes) (excluded from evaluation)
* Unreliable signal (periods of maternal heart rate or too much missing signal preventing good analysis) (excluded from evaluation)
* Not to analyse (period not to be analysed due to insufficient signal before or after for baseline positioning)
* Training data (boolean set to 1 if recording is part of the training dataset and 0 of part of evaluation)

The baseline, accelerations, decelerations, and over-shoots are not publicly shared for the recordings in the evaluation dataset to avoid any training on those data.

It states that the files are also available in WFDB format on the PhysioNet page, but I've not yet been able to identify the Physionet page.

These files are either from **expert evaluation, or automated analysis** from 12 different methods available in the literature. Methods in table below as from [[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100428), ordered by their performance in their evaluation of them. Not included in FHRMA but included in the leaderboard are two methods from Zhong et al. 2022, which perform in 1st and 3rd place.

| Function name | Filename | Publication | Baseline computation method | Acceleration/deceleration thresholding described? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aamwmfb | WMFB_orig.mat | Boudet et al. (2020) | Based on a weighted median filter baseline (WMFB). The weights are set to the prior probabilities that the FHR is in the baseline state. The unstable FHR periods have low probabilities. Successive baselines are computed with a progressive trimming process. Periods far from previous baselines have also low probabilities. | Yes |
| aamlu | L_std.mat | Lu et Wei (2012) | A method using empirical mode decomposition; periods exhibiting significant differences between two successive local FHR minima are excluded from the baseline computation. | No (probably standard thresholding) |
| aamhouze | H_std.mat | Houzé et al. (1990) | Based on a series of logic rules applied to various signal derivatives, followed by a smoothing step. | No (not described clearly enough to be reprogrammed) |
| aamtaylor | T_orig.mat / T_std.mat | Taylor et al. (2000) | A linear low-pass filtering method with progressive trimming. | Yes |
| aamwrobel | W_std.mat | Wróbel et al. (2013) | Based on myriad filters: an intermediate approach, between a linear average filter and use of the mode. | No (probably standard thresholding) |
| aammongelli | MG_std.mat | Mongelli et al. (1997) | This method computes a primary mode and a secondary mode; the two modes can be switched, depending on continuity and frequency criteria. | No |
| aamayres | A_std.mat | Ayres de Campos et al. (2000) | Based on “frequent” FHR values in a 10-min moving window. | Yes (= standard thresholding) |
| aammantel | MT_orig.mat / MT_std.mat | Mantel et al. (1990) | The method uses the mode or another local maximum of the FHR histogram to obtain an initial baseline. The final baseline is obtained by progressively trimming the first baseline (based on Dawes et al.’s method). This method was developed for antepartum recording. | Yes |
| aampardey | P_std.mat | Pardey et al. (2002) | The method first uses the histogram’s mode or another local maximum. The second baseline is obtained by linear filtering of the FHR and trimming as a function of the first baseline (based on Dawes et al.’s method). | Yes (=standard thresholding) |
| aamjimenez | J_orig.mat / J_std.mat | Jimenez et al. (2002) | Unstable periods (with a derivative above a cut-off) are removed, and the baseline is calculated after smoothing the remaining signal. | Yes |
| aammaeda | MD_std.mat | Maeda et al. (2012) | The baseline is set to the FHR level that occurs most often within a 10 bpm-wide bin. | No (not described clearly enough to be reprogrammed) |
| aamcazares | C_orig.mat/ C_std.mat | Cazares et al. (2002) | Based on morphological filters; an opening filter removes accelerations and a closing filter removes decelerations. | Only described for acceleration (presumably the same for deceleration) |

It also contains work around identification of false signals which is described in [this pre-print](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202207.0131/v1) and in [these python files](https://github.com/utsb-fmm/FHRMA/tree/master/FS%20training%20python%20sources).

In their [presentation on YouTube](https://youtu.be/gjpBs4utlbM?si=Y4HOXwd0FEzbbZiD&t=1146), can see that the training and test data are from two different sources:
* Training dataset is 66 recordings, duration 90 min (30 min - 7 hours), digitial acquisition or scan, medium or hard to assess, consensus of 3 experts
* Test dataset is 90 recordings, duration 105 min (90 min - 120 min), digitial acquisition, easy or medium or hard to assess, 3 independent experts and a consensus

### fECG datasets

There are other monitoring techniques like fetal ECG. Examples of publicly available dataset on PhysioNet of fetal ECG (as from [this review](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8820039)):
* The Abdominal and Direct Fetal ECG Database (ADFECGDB)
* The Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Database (NIFECGDB)
* The 2013 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge Database
* The Fetal ECG Synthetic Database (FECGSYNDB)
* The Non-invasive Fetal ECG Arrhythmia Database (NIFEADB) 

## Antenatal analysis

The development of antepartum computerized CTG (cCTG) began in 1978 based on criteria devised by Geoffrey Dawes and Chris Redman (Dawes–Redman criteria). Since then, the algorithm has been upgraded and improved repeatedly, and is now reportedly based on approximately 100 000 CTG traces linked to clinical outcome data spanning 20 years. The main advantage of cCTG with Dawes–Redman criteria over ‘conventional’ CTG is that it expresses components of the fetal heart rate (FHR) in an objective and numerically quantifiable way. This has led to cCTG being adopted as the recommended tool for antepartum monitoring over CTG in the UK by the NHS Saving Babies' Lives Care Bundle (SBLCBv2).[[source]](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/uog.26198 )

The computation of the Dawes–Redman criteria remains proprietary knowledge. Minimum duration of fetal monitoring is 10 min; analysis is performed at 10 min and every 2 min thereafter, up to a maximum of 60 min. In the presence of sufficient elements to be classified as normal (i.e. ‘criteria met’), monitoring can be stopped. The main components are:

![Dawes-Redman criteria](./images/dawes-redman.jpg)

[[source]](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/uog.26198 )

The Dawes-Redman analysis cannot be used in the presence of uterine contractions as this can be falsely reassuring.

It was commercialised as the Huntleigh Healthcare Ltd Sonicaid FM800. “Huntleigh are the exclusive worldwide distributor (under the licence from Oxford University) for the genuine Dawes-Redman analysis developed by Dawes, Redman et al, at the University of Oxford. Products produced by other companies will not have been validated against the University of Oxford’s unique database (where the system was and continues to be developed) and therefore will not perform in the same way.”[[source]](https://www.huntleigh-diagnostics.com/sonicaid-dawes-redman-ctg-analysis)


## Studies evaluating the use of CTG analysis systems in clinical practice

Several of the automated analysis methods have been developed as commercial products and evaluated in clinical practice. These are decision-support systems which provide alerts when there are concerns.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10091007)

There are some systems for monitoring during labour (antenatal) (e.g. System 8000 (Dawes and Redman) and improved version called sonicadFetalCare; 2CTG2). For monitoring during labour, systems include:
* **Porto** (based on FIGO), later commercialised **SisPorto** and **Omniview-SisPorto**, and the latest version is **Sis-Porto 4.0** (based on 2015 FIGO guidelines) - as described in [Ayres-de-Campos et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2016.1161750)
* **INFANT** (K2 Medical Systems, Plymouth, UK) - as described in [this Lancet publication](https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0140-6736(17)30568-8), although note that the co-inventor of INFANT, co-founder of K2 Medical Systems, and member of authorship and Clinical Investigator's group resigned as author from the paper [as in this commentary](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30714-6)
* **OxSys** is a new prototype that analyses and triggers 

Most of these systems have undergone years of work, testing and clinicial validation in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Description of some of the studies, as from [[source]](https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10091007):
| Software | Study design | Sample size | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INFANT | RCT | 46042 | **No difference**. Incidence of poor neonatal outcomes was the same regardless of using the decision support system, 0.7% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio 1.01, 95% CI:0.82–1.25) |
| Omniview-SisPorto 3.5 | RCT | 7730 | **No difference**. While both study arms reported lower than expected rate of newborn metabolic acidosis, no significant reduction in the metabolic rate or obstetric intervention was achieved using computerised analysis (relative risk 0.69, 95% CI:0.36–1.31) |
| OxSys 1.5 | Retrospective | 22790 | **Sensitivity change not stat sig, FPR change was**. OxSys system potentially increased the sensitivity of fetal compromise detection (43.3% vs. 38.0% for severe, p = 0.3 and 36.1% vs. 31.0% for moderate, p = 0.06) while reducing the false positive rate (14.4% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001) compared to conventional clinical diagnosis; however, the sensitivity increase was not statistically significant.|

Two recent **meta-analyses** also concluded similar findings that **computerised CTG analysis did not improve neonatal outcomes compared to conventional evaluation**.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10091007)

## Methods using human-guided features (e.g. PICO guidelines acceleration, deceleration) of the signals (either papers focusing on producing the features, or also doing classification)
