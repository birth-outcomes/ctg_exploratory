## Abstract
This database, from the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague and the University Hospital in Brno (UHB), contains 552 cardiotocography (CTG) recordings, which were carefully selected from 9164 recordings collected between 2010 and 2012 at UHB.

## Data Description
The CTG recordings start no more than 90 minutes before actual delivery, and each is at most 90 minutes long. Each CTG contains a fetal heart rate (FHR) time series and a uterine contraction (UC) signal, each sampled at 4 Hz.

The priority was to create as homogeneous a set as possible; thus only recordings fulfilling the following criteria were included:

* Singleton pregnancy
* Gestational age >36 weeks
* No a priori known developmental defects
* Duration of stage 2 of labor ≤ 30 minutes
* FHR signal quality (i.e. percentage of the recording during which FHR data were available) > 50% in each 30 minute window
* Available analysis of biochemical parameters of umbilical arterial blood sample (i.e. pH)
* Majority of vaginal deliveries (only 46 cesarean section (CS) deliveries included)

Additional parameters were collected for all recordings, and are available in the (text) .hea files of the records:

* Maternal data: age; parity; gravidity;
* Delivery data: type of delivery (vaginal; operative vaginal; CS); duration of delivery; meconium stained fluid; type of measurement (i.e. ultrasound or direct scalp electrode);
* Fetal data: sex; birth weight;
* Fetal outcome data: analysis of umbilical artery blood sample (i.e. pH; pCO2; pO2; base excess and computed BDecf); Apgar score; neonatology evaluation (i.e. need for O2; seizures; admission to NICU)
* Expert evaluation of the CTG data "Gold Standard" evaluation based on annotation of the signals by 9 expert obstetricians (following FIGO guidelines used in the Czech Republic) including variability/confidence for each signal (Note: these data are not yet available!)

## Annotations dataset

A proposed dataset with annotations for the 552 CTG recordings is provided by [Romagnoli et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.105690). The file "ANNOTATIONS" from the PhysioNet download is empty. This dataset of annotations is available as supplementary materials of their paper, as MATLAB data files (.mat).

Their paper was published under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED, under which you are free to share materials (not clear on what the reuse allowance is). However, the paper is stating that the database only contains traces so through adding annotations, it supports technical developments, and can support development, testing and comparison of algorithms for analysis of the CTG recordings.
