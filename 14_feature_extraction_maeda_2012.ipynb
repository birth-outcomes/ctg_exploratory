    "# Feature extraction part 2 - Maeda et al. 2012 baseline FHR, accelerations and decelerations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains on from `12_feature_extraction.ipynb`, looking at replicating some of the other methods in the FHRMA toolbox. As my first attempt to replicate Taylor et al. 2000 didn't match FHRMA - likely due to the differences in the Butterworth filter - I instead below tried a simpler method that just splits up the data and takes average, and compared against FHRMA results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some observations to be aware of:**\n",
    "* This method used modes, but that meant the baseline FHR would vary quite notably if the mode changed (as it's not uncommon for it to be a close call between modes). For example, which mode is chosen in a multi-mode situation. I have found examples where FHRMA was the min and examples where it was the max.\n",
    "* In the calculation of baseline FHR and detection of accelerations and decelerations, I have noted points where I think FHRMA's implementation differs from that described in the paper from Maeda et al. 2012. These include:\n",
    "    * Calculation of mean from all values in bin rather than 5-minute interval values in bin (as I think it makes sense it would be the interval)\n",
    "    * Calculation of fHR for last interval using points from the previous interval to pad to 150 (as I have not found mention of this in the paper - but its not implausible)\n",
    "    * Excluding reference lines in accelerations/decelerations (as these are described in the paper as being used)\n",
    "* There appears to be issues with some of the uploaded files - when viewed in Python or Octave, they contain alot of 0s (if not entirely 0s) - yet the FHRMA results appear to be fine.\n",
    "* When files containing 0s are processed on Octave, it hits an error."

    "* **Reference line** - \"Data-to-data difference in FHR were averaged (F bpm) and added to the baseline data to define the upper reference line (FHR baseline + F/2), and subtracted from the baseline data to define the lower reference line (FHR baseline –F/2).\"\n",
    "* **Deceleration** - \"A transient FHR decrease of more than 15 bpm below the lower reference line lasting longer than 15 seconds was defined as a deceleration. An FHR decrease appearing during transient tachycardia with a nadir of 110 bpm or more was not considered a deceleration but instead a transient recovery to the normal baseline.\"\n",
    "* **Late Deceleration** - \"The DIP SHAPE value was applied to the classification of deceleration, and was calculated by dividing the dip area ((sum of the FHR data in the deceleration) x 2) by ((deceleration amplitude x duration (seconds)) (Fig. 2). A decrease in FHR was defined as late deceleration (LD) if the following four conditions were met within 15 minutes: (1) the lag time between the contraction peak and FHR nadir was longer than 20 seconds in 60 % or more decelerations: (2) the number of deceleration was more than the contraction number – 1: (3) the DIP SHAPE value was less than 0.5: and (4) the dip variability (sum of FHR n – FHR n-1 in the deceleration) was less than 60 bpm). A decrease in FHR was defined as early deceleration (ED) if the DIP SHAPE value was less than 0.5, dip irregularity was less than 60 bpm and the lag time was almost zero.\"\n",
    "* **Variable Deceleration** - \"A decrease in FHR was defined as a variable deceleration (VD) if the DIP SHAPE was greater than 0.6 and dip variability was greater than 60 bpm\"\n",
    "* **Severe variable Deceleration** - A variable deceleration with a nadir heart rate less than 100 bpm and duration longer than 60 seconds was defined as severe variable deceleration (SVD)\n",
    "* **Prolonged Deceleration** - Deceleration lasting longer than 2 minutes\n",
    "* **Acceleration** - A transient rise in FHR of 15 bpm or more above the upper reference line lasting 15 seconds or more , after 30 weeks of pregnancy, was defined as FHR acceleration \n",
