    "In the context of the FIGO guidelines, the routinely judged FHR components, often called **FIGO-based or morphological features**, are the baseline heart rate, variability, accelerations, and decelerations. These components are the most robust indicators to ascertain fetal well-being. For this reason, in almost all studies that address automated CTG analysis, these basic morphological features are confirmed as an indispensable part of the analyses. The initial studies on automated CTG analysis focused on the detection of morphological features that clinicians examine with the naked eye, but this is challenging due to a lack of standards on how computers estimate the diagnostic indices.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2018.05.016)\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have since explored the use of other features from **linear, non-linear, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), time-frequency and image-based time-frequency (IBTF) domains**.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2018.05.016)\n",

    "\n",

    "* **Porto** (based on FIGO), later commercialised **SisPorto** and **Omniview-SisPorto**, and the latest version is **Sis-Porto 4.0** (based on 2015 FIGO guidelines) - as described in [Ayres-de-Campos et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2016.1161750)\n",

    "| Omniview-SisPorto 3.5 | RCT | 7730 | **No difference**.
