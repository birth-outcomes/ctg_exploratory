    "## About the CTG files\n",
    "The FHRMA toolbox provides 66 training files and 90 test files with raw CTG data. They are stored as binary .fhr files. The signals were sampled at 4 Hz and stored in the following format. For each sample:\n",
    "* A uint32 serves as the UNIX timestamp for the beginning of the recording\n",
    "* A uint16 corresponds to the FHR from the first sensor (multiplied by 4)\n",
    "* A uint16 for the FHR signal from the second sensor (multiplied by 4) (unused here)\n",
    "* A uint8 for the TOCO signal (multiplied by 2)\n",
    "* A uint8 reserved to store signal quality (unused here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The FHR signal is set to 0 when it is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background information on binary files\n",
    "Binary files consist of sequential bytes, which are each 8 bits long. Bits are 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files typically have a header indicating the file type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A byte can represent a number from 0 to 255, or -127 to +127 if you use one bit to indicate the minus sign. Groups of bytes can be used to represent larger numbers, for example:\n",
    "| Number of bytes (or bits) | Name | Range (will - this to + this) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1 (8 bits) | Byte | 128 |\n",
    "| 2 (16 bits) | Short | 32,768 |\n",
    "| 4 (32 bits) | Int | 2,147,483,648 |\n",
    "| 8 (64 bits) | Int64 | 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 |\n",
